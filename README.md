Map-Based JavaScript Application üåç‚úàÔ∏è

Explore the globe with our interactive map application, utilizing the power of the Leaflet library and Mapbox API. 

Key Features:

Global Language Standardization: Integrates the Mapbox API with the Leaflet library to ensure all map labels are displayed in English, providing a consistent user experience across the globe.

Location Search: Users can search for any location in the world. Experience a smooth 'fly-to' animation that transports you directly to your chosen destination.

Continent Navigation: Interactive navigation through a navbar allows users to select continents and 'fly' to them.


Work in progress: just a fun thing I enjoy working on, lots of potential with this kind of technology, I'm thinking a wildlife tracking app or something could be a very cool outcome but would probably scale to React Native so it can be accessed everywhere.
